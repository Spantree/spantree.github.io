In this episode we add functionality to the navigation items on the header. When an item is clicked, its model's attributes
changes. This sets the groundwork for the following episode where these same events will render different
views.
You can get the code from [github](https://github.com/uris77/tdd-mocha-screencast/tree/PartIII).
